One vintage computing goal I had was to be able to use AOL Instant Messenger on vintage computers.

Fortunately, someone has implemented AIM's (and ICQ's) server in a single portable Go binary: [retro-aim-server](https://github.com/mk6i/retro-aim-server).

Note: Legacy AIM is unencrypted and vintage computers shouldn't be directly connected to the Internet, so if you'll only want to set this up on a virtual private network, e.g. using [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/).
