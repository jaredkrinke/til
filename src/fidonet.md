Despite being old enough to remember dialing into a [bulletin board system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system) (BBS), I never knew until recently (while watching [BBS: The Documentary](http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/)) that **BBSes were eventually networked together, mainly under a scheme called [FidoNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FidoNet)**. It's hard to imagine that globe-spanning email and forums existed for the general public prior to the Internet. Apparently FidoNet persists even to this day!
