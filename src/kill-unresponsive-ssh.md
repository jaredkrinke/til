title: Kill unresponsive SSH sessions with "Enter, ~, ."

If an SSH session has gone unresponsive, you can terminate it with a special escape sequence:

* Enter
* `~` (tilde)
* `.` (period)

I've only had to use this on slow servers after my computer when in and out of standby. At the time, I didn't see any other options.
