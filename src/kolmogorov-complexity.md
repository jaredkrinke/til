While reading [Small Programs and Languages](https://ratfactor.com/cards/pl-small) on ratfactor.com, I came across **Kolmogorov Complexity**, which someone described on Wikipedia as:

> the length of a shortest computer program (in a predetermined programming language) that produces the object as output

I don't really have any particular reason to use this concept, but I like the idea that there *is* a shortest computer program for outputting some result. Rather than write anymore here, I recommend reading the article linked above.
