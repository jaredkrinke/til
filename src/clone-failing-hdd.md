[OpenSuperClone](https://github.com/ISpillMyDrink/OpenSuperClone) can cautiously clone failing rotational hard disks, similar to [ddrescue](https://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/).

Once cloned, you can safely attempt reading from the clone and maybe even try repairing the file system or scanning for orphaned files.
