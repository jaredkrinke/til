<h1>Use &quot;GO386=softfloat&quot; to compile Go for Pentium</h1>

<p>Cross-compiling is trivial with pure-Go projects. For example, to compile for a Pentium (maybe even a 486 DX?) running NetBSD, just set a few variables:</p>
<pre><code>GOOS=netbsd GOARCH=386 GO386=softfloat make
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>GO386=softfloat</code> setting is necessary for Pentium I/II--without specifying it, <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/40255">Go 1.16 requires SSE2 by default for &quot;GOARCH=386&quot;</a>, and I believe that's only supported on Pentium 4+.</p>
<p>Why do I know this? I have a late '90s Dell Latitude CP (Pentium 233 MHz with 128 MB RAM) running NetBSD and I wanted to run the <a href="https://aerc-mail.org/">aerc</a> mail client on it. Unfortunately, the prebuilt &quot;i386&quot; NetBSD package crashed with <code>SIGILL</code> (illegal instruction). Loading the core dump into GDB revealed that an <code>xorps</code> instruction was the problem because that instruction was introduced as part of SSE2 (well after my Pentium was manufactured). I have not yet investigated whether or not it's expected for prebuilt binary packages on &quot;i386&quot; NetBSD to require a Pentium 4, but in my case recompiling the pure-Go aerc project was trivial and I can now read modern email on a nearly 30 year old computer.</p>
