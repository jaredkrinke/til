<p>Despite seeing consistent praise for Apple's accessibility efforts, Safari on iOS always had a glaring issue: dark mode links were dark-blue-on-black when using their default styles (unlike every other browser that chose a reasonable contrast ratio).</p>
<p>A few days ago, however, I noticed that this issue has finally been fixed! That means <strong>you can finally use dark mode <em>without explicitly specifying colors</em> and have it be legible for the large number of iPhone users out there</strong>. Here's how this site's dark mode is implemented:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">:root { color-scheme: light dark; }
</code></pre>
<p>That's all that's required, thanks to default styles!</p>
