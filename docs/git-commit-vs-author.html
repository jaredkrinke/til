<p>Commits in Git have both an <strong>author</strong> and a <strong>committer</strong>. The distinction makes sense, although it probably doesn't matter in the vast majority of cases.</p>
<p>But, of course, GitHub decided to surface <em>both</em> of these bits of information, so if you want a commit to show up as someone else on GitHub specifically, you'll need to type in a very long command line (or script) with lots of redundant information (or at least I haven't found a better solution yet):</p>
