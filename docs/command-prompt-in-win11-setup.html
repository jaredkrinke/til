<p>Use <strong>Shift+F10</strong> to open a command prompt while you're in the Windows 11 setup flow.</p>
<p>While clean-installing Windows 11 for someone, I wasn't able to sign into their Microsoft Account because no network drivers were present. In order to extract HP's network drivers, I needed to be able to run their self-extracting executables, thus I needed a command prompt.</p>
