<p>Despite being old enough to remember dialing into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system">bulletin board system</a> (BBS), I never knew until recently (while watching <a href="http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/">BBS: The Documentary</a>) that <strong>BBSes were eventually networked together, mainly under a scheme called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FidoNet">FidoNet</a></strong>. It's hard to imagine that globe-spanning email and forums existed for the general public prior to the Internet. Apparently FidoNet persists even to this day!</p>
