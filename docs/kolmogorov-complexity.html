<p>While reading <a href="https://ratfactor.com/cards/pl-small">Small Programs and Languages</a> on ratfactor.com, I came across <strong>Kolmogorov Complexity</strong>, which someone described on Wikipedia as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the length of a shortest computer program (in a predetermined programming language) that produces the object as output</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't really have any particular reason to use this concept, but I like the idea that there <em>is</em> a shortest computer program for outputting some result. Rather than write anymore here, I recommend reading the article linked above.</p>
