<p>When you connect to a server the first time using Secure Shell (SSH), you are shown the server's public key fingerprint. How do you validate that fingerprint?</p>
<ul>
<li>If it's a public/well-known server, they should publish their SSH fingerprints -- make sure to view them over HTTPS and not unencrypted HTTP</li>
<li>If it's your own private server, use <code>ssh-keygen -lf &lt;path to *.pub file</code>, e.g.:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>ssh-keygen -lf /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub
</code></pre>
<p>I didn't actually learn this <em>today</em>, but it's a command I use frequently enough that I wanted to write it down somewhere.</p>
