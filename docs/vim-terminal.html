<h1>Use &quot;:terminal&quot; in Vim for a better integrated terminal</h1>

<p><strong>Vim has a fully integrated terminal that can be accessed via <code>:ter</code> (<code>:terminal</code>)</strong> (run <code>:help :terminal</code> to learn about it):</p>
<ul>
<li>It creates a split that <strong>operates like a normal Vim window</strong> (switch/move via <code>Ctrl+w</code> and <code>hjkl/HJKL</code>)</li>
<li>You can <strong>move around or mousewheel scroll by entering &quot;normal&quot; mode with <code>Ctrl+w, N</code></strong> (N.B. capital <code>N</code>)</li>
<li>Hit <strong><code>i</code> to go back to shell/&quot;job&quot; mode</strong></li>
<li>While in &quot;normal&quot; mode (usual Vim navigation mode), you can copy (&quot;yank&quot;) with <code>y</code> as usual</li>
<li>In shell (&quot;job&quot;) mode, you <em>cannot</em> paste using <code>p</code> and instead need to <strong>use <code>Ctrl+w, &quot;, &quot;</code> to paste/&quot;put&quot;</strong> (yes, two quotation marks--this apparently is pasting from a Vim register named <code>&quot;</code>)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>As a long time terminal user, I'm generally interacting with the terminal via <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">GNU Screen</a>, which allows me to quickly switch between virtual terminals, split the screen, copy-paste without the mouse, etc. These days, <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki">tmux</a> appears more popular (likely for good reasons like persisting screen splits), but terminal multiplexers aren't the only game in town.</p>
<p>Namely, Emacs has an integrated shell that supports copy/paste, Emacs movement shortcuts, and probably a lot more I haven't discovered. Regardless, I still regularly use Vim due to its lighter footprint and my own muscle memory.</p>
<p>I was aware of <code>:shell</code> in vi/Vim, but it's clunky and doesn't integrate with Vim--it's more of a way to leave vi and then come back easily. Recently, I was pointed to <code>:terminal</code> and it is <em>so</em> much better than <code>:shell</code>, thanks to the features noted above.</p>
