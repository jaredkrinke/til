<p>It turns out there's a reason that the C standard library has such cryptic names for its functions:</p>
<p><strong>Early C (including ANSI C, a.k.a. C89, if I understand correctly) required external functions to have their first 6 characters be unique.</strong></p>
<p>I even saw a claim that <code>strncpy</code> would have been <code>strcpyn</code> if not for this limitation. As much as I enjoy the simplicity and ubiquity of C, it <em>does</em> come with a noticeable amount of annoying baggage.</p>
