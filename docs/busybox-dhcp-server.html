<p>On an isolated network, you may want to run a DHCP server. Luckily, you might already have one installed via Busybox:</p>
<p>Just create a symlink to <code>busybox</code> named <code>udhcpd</code>!</p>
<p>Sample config:</p>
<pre><code>interface eth0

start 172.16.0.50
end 172.16.0.99

option subnet 255.255.255.0
option router 172.16.0.1
</code></pre>
<p>Just run the symlinked binary with the config file as an argument (<code>-f</code> runs in the foreground, for monitornig purposes):</p>
<pre><code>./udhcpd -f udhcpd.conf
</code></pre>
<p>The config above only assigns IPs on the <code>eth0</code> interface (useful if you're e.g. routing to a VPN on another interface), providing IPs on the specified range, with a gateway of <code>172.16.0.1</code>.</p>
<p>Oddly, <code>netstat -tulpn</code> shows the process listening on all IPs, but it didn't respond on other interfaces, so it seems to work as intended. I wouldn't recommend running a Busybox DHCP server on an exposed network, just in case.</p>
<p>My use case was running an isolated network of vintage computers locally and routing them through a WireGuard VPN over the Internet to other locations. Having a DHCP server allowed me to just plug a router into a Raspberry Pi running WireGuard and this DHCP server.</p>
