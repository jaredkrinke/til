<p><strong>The GNU Debugger (GDB) has a built-in TUI mode</strong> that can be accessed with the <code>tui</code> command or by passing <code>-tui</code> on the command line. It provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Source file view</li>
<li>Multiple windows (using Emacs keybindings)</li>
<li><strong>Single Key mode</strong> (enter/exit using Ctrl+x, s)</li>
</ul>
<p>That last one is exciting because it allows for quickly stepping through code using:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>n</code>: &quot;next&quot; (which I would call &quot;step over&quot;)</li>
<li><code>s</code>: &quot;step&quot; (which I would call &quot;step into&quot;)</li>
<li><code>f</code>: &quot;finish&quot; (whicih I would call &quot;step out&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<p>I've never enjoyed using GDB because I never took the time to learn it. As someone with extensive experience in WinDbg, I didn't understand how Linux developers could put up with GDB's clunky line-based interface--it turns out they probably don't! I suspect they use GDB's TUI mode, a separate GDB frontend, ... or printf debugging!</p>
